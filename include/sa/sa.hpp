/**
 * Here we implement the Simulated Annealing algorithm with
 * exponential temperature schedule.
 *
 * The problem with simulated annealing is that it has several
 * parameters that need to be configured well in order for it
 * to work.
 * The proper configuration of the parameters depends on the
 * scale of the objective function value as well as on the
 * available computation budget, and even stuff like, e.g.,
 * the expected differences in objective values of local optima.
 *
 * This makes it very complicated to properly use it for
 * black-box settings where absolutely nothing is known
 * about the objective function.
 *
 * Still, to be able to do some experiments, we propose the
 * following automatic setup based on the number 'n' of
 * variables of the problem:
 *
 * - the temperature schedule is exponential
 * - the start temperature is such that it time 1 the
 *   probability to accept a solution which is n/4 worse
 *   than the current solution would be 0.1
 * - the end temperature is such that the probability to
 *   accept a solution which is 1 worse than the current
 *   solution is 1/sqrt(n)
 * - the value of the epsilon parameter of the schedule
 *   is computed accordingly
 *
 * This will have several implications:
 *
 * - Problems that can be solved easily (OneMax,
 *   LeadingOnes) will be _still_ solved late in the runs.
 *   This is normal for simulated annealing, as the goal
 *   is to transcend from random walk to hill climbing
 *   behavior.
 * - Problems whose objective value range differs largely
 *   from n (e.g., LARS) will probably not be solved well.
